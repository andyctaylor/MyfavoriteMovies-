# Project Overview
This project aims to create a dynamic website where I can:
- List: Showcase my favorite movies with details like title, director, year, and genre.
- Search: Quickly find specific movies within my collection.
- Filter: Explore movies by genre.
Add/Edit: Maintain an updated list of my favorite films.

The project also serves as a learning ground for best practices in Django development and web design.

# Key Django Concepts
Through this project, I've gained a solid understanding of the following Django concepts:

# What is Django? 
A high-level web framework that encourages rapid development and clean design.
- Templates: How Django templates (using the Django Template Language) separate the presentation layer from the logic, making my code more organized.
- Tags: Leveraging built-in Django template tags like {% for %}, {% if %}, and {% url %} to dynamically control the content displayed.

# Template Inheritance: 
Creating base templates that define the overall site structure, and extending them in child templates for specific pages (like movie details).

-  Models: Designing database models using Django's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to represent movies, genres, and other relevant data.
- Views: Writing Python functions (views) that handle requests, fetch data from the database, and render templates to present the information.
- URLs: Configuring URL patterns to associate specific views with different parts of the website.
- Forms: Building and validating forms to handle user input (e.g., adding new movies).

# Features
- Movie Listing: Browse a list of my favorite movies with a clean and responsive layout.
- Movie Details: View in-depth information about each movie.
- Search Functionality: Quickly find movies by title or director.
- Genre Filtering: Explore movies by specific genres.
- User Authentication (Future): Allow users to create accounts and manage their own movie lists (under development).
- API Integration (Future): Fetch movie data from external sources like TMDB (The Movie Database) (under development).
